## About The Project
Have you ever wondered how much water you would need to fill your pool, or perhaps want to find out information about the pool out of curiosity. Look no further! With this web application you can enter the dimensions of a pool and immediately find out additional information about it. Like **perimeter** or **surface area**, because every pool can be divided into simple shapes.

This project can always be improved, so if you find any problems with the app or have suggestions you can report them [here](https://github.com/FadoBagy/PoolBuilder/issues), and they will be addressed as soon as possible. Any feedback is appreciated.
